## Other Noteworthy Stuff

### The website has an short url alias: [https://cnp.is](https://cnp.is)
Most of the times, you can substitute `codynhanpham.com` with `cnp.is` to get to the same page quicker.

### Many hidden pages
Not all of the pages are linked with the main page. You can of course access them by typing the url directly. What are those pages? Who knows?

### Most of the pages are written in Markdown and rendered to HTML
I have created a custom markdown to HTML renderer for this site with custom styles. While it's for my personal use, you can also check it out [here](https://github.com/codynhanpham/markdown-to-html).
Most of the time, if you add `index.md` to the end of the url, you can see the markdown version of the page. For example, [https://codynhanpham.com/resume/index.md](https://codynhanpham.com/resume/index.md) will show you the markdown version of the about page.
