# If care equals infinity

Blank. It has been like this for the past hour. If I toggle the light mode on, even for a second, my eyes would be shredded by the two-million tiny dots right in front of me. I don't know; a flash might clear something up, and even if it doesn't, at least it would keep me up for the next hour or so. Not that I don't have any idea to put down - I can fill a book full of ideas if I have to - but to put them down compellingly and dramatically, that's the problem. Why does writing have to be so stress-inducing? Why do I have to care about the audience's retention if all they want to know is what's in my head? Why can't writing literature be like writing code: just let me place my ideas down in position and get straight to the problem?

</br>

```js
const mind = require(“consciousness”);
let idea = mind.filter(items => items.thought > 0);
console.log(idea);
```

</br>

I did it again. I know I shouldn't do any coding now but instead, focus on this paper. Visual Studio and Word are just one "Alt-Tab" away from each other, and the urge is too hard for me to resist. My retention on one task is extremely low, but only when I feel like nothing is being accomplished. An hour is enough for me to write the whole codebase for a Wordle game solver, but never enough to finish an essay opening. Though, I know, for sure, after I get the first sentence down, things will go very smoothly. "Blank."

I never say I hate writing literature. I love writing to the deepest place in my heart as it is the only medium that I can rely on to save my thoughts and feelings. To me, words fly. I love to think any ideas, thoughts, or sensations that come to me are just one of those tiny little fireflies when they get disturbed from their peaceful place and must get away somehow. They have always been there, but you could never see such beautiful creatures when things are too quiet. When a right rustle comes, a firefly flees, sparks while on its way like there is nothing to fear, and turbulences are just the mean for it to reach its final shape. It will get away, forever, if you are not ready to catch it right when it appears. I love to capture anything that comes up, feeling or thought, and put it down on paper. As simple as that: no rules, no orders, no stress, no fear. It's nice to have all pieces of memory recorded just in case sometime in the future I might need to recall and relive the joy and happiness of the past.

Writing is nice. I can remember once I tried to write a blog post on social media. It got thousands of interactions, and I was so proud and honored. I believe I am a writer, at least I thought I was. People did read and interact with the posts I wrote. But putting words down for people to enjoy is so not enjoyable. Why do I have to care if someone else actually read my work or just say they did? Why do I have to care for their low retention span, and change up things I would never write otherwise just so they enjoy reading my piece? A true writer has to. Not only how they feel about their work, but also how the audience may perceive that work. At least that is what a comment five years ago on all my posts told me. I didn't record it; I have never put it down. Some negative thoughts keep following me even when I try to filter them out.

Writing, for myself, is nice. Since then, the only kind of writing I do voluntarily and not for myself is writing code and instructions to use it. It's universal, and there is no need for ornaments.

</br>

```js
let things = require(“subconsciousness”);
things.forEach((thing) => {
    if (thing.type == “!”) { thing = null };
});
```

</br>

Imagine a future where you can control yourself with codes. But even then, it's hard to tell where certain things came from, let alone manage them. I'm pretty good at explaining things I understand to someone else informatively. Perhaps, I am used to it. At the same time, I am terrible at explaining parts of myself. I don't understand it. I keep many notebooks I write about myself with the hope that one day I can see some patterns of the things that keep coming up from time to time. And just sometimes, "thing" is nice and comforting.

> ***"I sat alone in my room, passed out, and felt like I was ten thousand miles back at home. I smelled the damp wood of my old desk dad made for me when I was ten, where I used to study till I fell asleep. I recalled so vividly the hug from mom. I got goosebumps. I always thought I was so used to being far from home. I have never had this feeling like I am twelve again, worries free."***

</br>

These moments I have them written down and labeled clearly as any other STEM student would have: a "~" for the nices and a "!" for the nots. Putting "!"s down on paper is also my way to cope with negativities, but sometimes it doesn't work the way I intended. Always, "!" keeps filling up, regardless of whether I do or don't write it down...

I always wish there was a way I could go through all the "!"s in my mind and set them to a simple blank. I think everyone would love to do that to themselves, too, if it's possible.

I try to put thoughts, hopefully, positive ones, into writings that I enjoy doing for myself. No one has the right to judge that. And for the most part, it's easy for me to put down my stream of thoughts on those notebooks. Somehow, just a similar act of writing, but writing, literature to be specific, for classes or social media is much more stressful than writing for my own. I always feel the pressure of having to do it right, I feel eyes locking on me, and just one mistake will trip me over. Or perhaps I don't have enough "care" that I wish I would put down in my literary works. Writing a one-thousand words essay for school can take me a day but writing the same length GitHub project description and instruction takes a couple of hours. Maybe a caring audience is what slows me down from writing: GitHub people read my project page just for the solutions, no more, no less, and no one else other than myself would read the notebooks I own. I wish there were some ways for humans to test theories about themselves, like if there is a variable slider that we can set for our own purpose.

</br>

```js
const whatIs = require(“feelings”);
whatIs[“care”].level = Math.pow(10, 1000);
```

</br>

The light mode did keep me going for quite some time. As the words fill up the blank, at least it's getting less and less painful on the eyes. "Another writing that's just like any others." My thought still keeps on rolling. To an extent, I believe I am a writer, not an overly entertaining one, but a "provided as is" one. I enjoy writing in the most literal sense it possibly means, as all I ever could capture is by the means of putting down words. But trying to impress the audience was once one of my chases, and just maybe, sometime in the future, I would love to live that chase once more.
